## Upgrade Process

### For Validators

1. Monitor governance proposals for upcoming upgrades
2. Download and verify the upgrade binary before the upgrade height
3. Stop the node at the specified upgrade height
4. Replace the binary with the new version
5. Restart the node to continue with the upgraded software

### For Node Operators

1. Follow the same process as validators
2. Ensure backup of node data before upgrades
3. Test upgrades on testnet before mainnet deployment

## Important Notes

- **Skip Versions**: Some version numbers (v4, v5, v8, v10, v12, v13, v15) changes were deployed as part of subsequent major releases
- **Binary Compatibility**: Each upgrade requires updating to the specific binary version - older versions will not work after the upgrade height
- **Governance**: All upgrades are coordinated through on-chain governance proposals that must pass before implementation

## Release Channels

- **GitHub Releases**: [burnt-labs/xion releases](https://github.com/burnt-labs/xion/releases)
- **Docker Images**: Available for each release version
- **Source Code**: Full source available on GitHub for building from source
