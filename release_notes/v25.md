# Xion v25 Release Notes

## Overview

The Xion v25 release marks a significant update to the Xion network, introducing a fully integrated Indexer Service, upgrading the Wasm engine, and refining core application logic. This release also includes various stability improvements. This upgrade migrates the chain from v21.0.1 to v25.0.1. The recommended version is v25.0.1.

- **Configuration**: Introduced a new `CustomConfig` structure that combines SDK, Wasm, and Indexer configurations. Added validation checks to ensure proper indexer configuration.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implemented graceful shutdown handling for the indexer service.

### App Improvements

- **Wasm Upgrade**: Upgraded `wasmd` to `v0.61.6-xion.2`, bringing in the latest improvements and fixes from the Wasm module.
- **IBC Hop Limit**: Implemented a limit of 10 for IBC hops to enhance security and stability.
- **Wasm Panic Fix**: Resolved a panic issue within the Wasm module.
- **Upgrade Handler**: Enhanced upgrade handler logging to track Wasm module versions before and after migrations.
